# Anonymous Course Feedback

This is a simple web page for collecting anonymous feedback from classmates about our education.
To send a message, you need a password that has been shared with the class.
Only those with the admin password can view the submitted feedback.

This allows me and the other student representative to gather honest criticism and suggestions, without anyone needing to speak face-to-face or feel uncomfortable sharing their thoughts.
