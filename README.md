# Anonymous Course Feedback

As a student representative, it is my responsibility to gather feedback from my classmates, regarding the courses, and education in general.
This is so that we can have an input on our education, and to help the school and management team to improve the courses.

Since feedback can be quite sensitive, and the classmate who wants to bring something to attention might want to stay anonymous, I created this small website for them to send feedback anonymously.

## Specs

The site opens up a simple page with a form consisting of a text-input field, a password input-field, and a submit button.
It also contains an admin login that only I have access too. Only here messages can be read.

To prevent unauthorized people from sending feedback, a password has been share within the class.
This password must be used every time someone wants to send feedback on anything.

Data is sent to a Firebase real-time database.
